	"howText": "With the affinity for technology-interaction, the scale deals with acontemporary topic, which is currently not considered enough in scientific studies. To give users an objective, reliable and valid result, the scale was developed in a scientific context. With the website you can easily reach a lot of people at no significant expense.",
	"why": "Why",
	"whyText": "The scale is a tool with lots of uses. Scientists are able to obtain helpful data about their probands. System developers can use the scale to figure out the affinity for technology of potential users before evaluating their prototypes. Or it can simplybe used by those who want to find out something about their personality traits.",
	"scientist": "Scientist",
	"scientistText": "You are a scientist or researcher and you are dealing with studies and probands? Then the ATI scale could be interesting for you. The affinity for technology is a recurring variable in many studies that is still rarely considered, eventhough it can affect the results of studies. With our scale you get a simple and easy way to determine the affinity of technology of your probands.",
	"developer": "Developer",
	"developerText": "You develop interactive systems? Then you can use the ATI-scale to determine the affinity of technology of probands when you evaluate your products. That way it can be ensured that probands with different affinity of technology are considered in the evaluation.",
	"teacher": "Teacher",
	"teacherText": "You are a teacher at a school or university? Then you can use the ATI-scale to better assess your students' affinity for technology. Based on that knowledge you can adjust the didactics of the course to the characteristics of the participants. This is becoming more important with the increasing use of technology in education.",

	"descQuestionnaire": "Thank you for using our scale to measureyour affinity for technology-interaction. This survey consists of three parts. In the first part, there are three questions to create your personal identifier (token). This token is needed to make sure that one person can not take part of this survey more than once. The second part of  survey consists of nine questions to determine your affinity for technology-interaction. The third and last part consists of a few questions about your demographic data. For us as researchers and developers of the ATI-Scale it is interesting to see how the results are related to specific population groups. For each question exactly one answer can be given. Completing this survey takes about 10 minutes. Please note that the survey is conducted completely anonymous. Your answers can not and will not be associated with you personally.",
