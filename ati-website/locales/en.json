  "downloadText": "Use our scale for development and research. Download the scale for your project.",
  "testYourselfText": "Or use the scale to learn something about your own affinity for technology and interactive systems.",
  "what": "What",
  "whatText": "With our scale you can easily and quickly measure your own technical affinity or that of your probands. For this purpose, the scale can be filled out directly on this page or simply downloaded. It takes about 5 minutes to complete the scale and it's possible on various devices. There are many more features as well. For example, you can see a comparison of the results of all participants.",
  "how": "How",
  "howText": "With the affinity for technology-interaction, the scale deals with acontemporary topic, which is currently not considered enough in scientific studies. To give users an objective, reliable and valid result, the scale was developed in a scientific context. With the website you can easily reach a lot of people at no significant expense.",
  "why": "Why",
  "whyText": "The scale is a tool with lots of uses. Scientists are able to obtain helpful data about their probands. System developers can use the scale to figure out the affinity for technology of potential users before evaluating their prototypes. Or it can simplybe used by those who want to find out something about their personality traits.",
  "scientist": "Scientist",
  "scientistText": "You are a scientist or researcher and you are dealing with studies and probands? Then the ATI scale could be interesting for you. The affinity for technology is a recurring variable in many studies that is still rarely considered, eventhough it can affect the results of studies. With our scale you get a simple and easy way to determine the affinity of technology of your probands.",
  "developer": "Developer",
  "developerText": "You develop interactive systems? Then you can use the ATI-scale to determine the affinity of technology of probands when you evaluate your products. That way it can be ensured that probands with different affinity of technology are considered in the evaluation.",
  "teacher": "Teacher",
  "teacherText": "You are a teacher at a school or university? Then you can use the ATI-scale to better assess your students' affinity for technology. Based on that knowledge you can adjust the didactics of the course to the characteristics of the participants. This is becoming more important with the increasing use of technology in education.",
