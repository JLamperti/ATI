With our scale you get a simple and easy way to determine the affinity of technology of your probands.",
  "developer": "Developer",
  "developerText": "You develop interactive systems? Then you can use the ATI-scale to determine the affinity of technology of probands when you evaluate your products. That way it can be ensured that probands with different affinity of technology are considered in the evaluation.",
  "teacher": "Teacher",
  "teacherText": "You are a teacher at a school or university? Then you can use the ATI-scale to better assess your students' affinity for technology. Based on that knowledge you can adjust the didactics of the course to the characteristics of the participants. This is becoming more important with the increasing use of technology in education.",
